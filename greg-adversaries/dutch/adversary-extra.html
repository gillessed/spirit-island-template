	for all purposes except two. Firstly, when invaders ravage, instead of doing 2 damage, they increase the damage of each non-ship invader in the land by 1 per ship.
	Additionally, they do not count as a town for the purposes of determining whether a town or a city is built, but lands with just ships still build."
