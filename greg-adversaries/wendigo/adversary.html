	and should be kept from other tokens in the land. During ravage, the wendigo's forces do damage at the same time as invaders, doing damage to normal invaders, {dahan} and the land. When normal {dahan}
	counterattack in that land, they may damage either normal invaders or the wendigo's forces. Build cards affect normal and wendigo invaders separately. This can cause two builds in a land. When time passes, if a wendigo
	is adjacent to a land matching a ravage card (after shifting), push the wendigo and its forces into an adjacent land matching a ravage card without {wendigo}. Invaders and {dahan} gathered out of a land with {wendigo}
	to a land without become normal invaders and {dahan}."
