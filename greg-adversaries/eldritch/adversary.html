			<section-title>ELDRITCH HORROR</section-title>
			<section-title>MYTHOS DECK</section-title>
			<special-rule>
				Replace the event deck with a constructed mythos deck with a number of cards equal to invader deck. The deck
				composition is [1y,1g], [1y,1g,2b], [2y,2g,1b].
				Shuffle each set of cards together, and stack them on top of one another. Do not resolve a mythos card on the
				first turn.
				<br><br>
				If you are playing with another adversary that removes invader cards from the deck, remove blue mythos cards,
				while keeping the number of yellow and green cards the same.
			</special-rule>

			<section-title>DOOM TRACK</section-title>
			<special-rule>
				Each of the ancient ones has an initial doom level. When the doom level reaches zero, the ancient one awakens.
				See the specific ancient one to determine what happens in that case. While the ancient one is on the board,
				spirits cannot win the game.
			</special-rule>
			<section-title>TOKENS</section-title>
			<special-rule>
				This adversary uses the tokens from the Eldritch Horror board game.
			</special-rule>
			<special-rules-subtitle>Corruption {corruption}</special-rules-subtitle>
			<special-rule>
				Corruption tokens track how much the ancient ones have made progress in corrupting the land and those who live
				on it.
			</special-rule>
			<special-rules-subtitle>Clues {clue}</special-rules-subtitle>
			<special-rule>
				Each spirit starts with an extra card named Investigate. This can be used to acquire clues. Spirits may spend
				{clue} during either the {fast} or {slow} phase as an
				action to remove {corruption} in one of their lands. When a clue token is spent this way, that spirit gains an
				element of their choice.
			</special-rule>

			<section-title>MYTHOS CARDS</section-title>
			<special-rule>
				Mythos cards are used instead of the event deck. Each mythos card will do some of the following keyword effects,
				and then also resolve a unique effect of their own.
			</special-rule>
			<special-rules-subtitle>Reckoning</special-rules-subtitle>
			<special-rule>
				See the specific rules for your elder one for the reckoning effect.
			</special-rule>
			<special-rules-subtitle>Advance Omen Track</special-rules-subtitle>
			<special-rule>
				The omen track is a cycle of the four land types: {jungle} -> {wetland} -> {sand} -> {mountain}. When the omen
				track is advanced, move a marker from one land type to the next. Then
				advance doom by 1 for each land matching the omen track with {corruption}.
			</special-rule>
			<special-rules-subtitle>Invader Surge</special-rules-subtitle>
			<special-rule>
				On an invader surge, on each board, add 1 {explorer} and 1 {town} to a land matching the omen track. If there is
				no such land on a board, instead pick any land.
			</special-rule>
			<special-rules-subtitle>Spawn Clues</special-rules-subtitle>
			<special-rule>
				On each board, add {clue} in the land with the fewest invaders.
