      <special-rule>
        If anything causes to push or gather your {presence}, you mush push or gather all {presence} from the source land into the same target land, except when you use the split pillar growth option.
        When your {presence} is in a land, that land needs track its pillar height. You can use energy tokens or dice to track this.
        Whenever the height of that land changes, if that height is now coprime with any adjacent lands' heights, you may push {presence} out
        of a land such that the pillars in question are no longer adjacent. Height trackers and element tokens move with the {presence}. This movement
        may cause cascading {presence} movement, but you can only move {presence} out of each land once.
        <br><br>
        When you add {presence} to a land without a height, it's height becomes 1. Height can never be lower than 1. If it would ever
        become lower than 1, it becomes 1 instead.
        <br><br>
        When your {presence} is destroyed in a land, if the land still has presence, subtract 1 from the height, otherwise remove all height
        and element tokens. When you push your {presence} from one land into another land with {presence} and height, the new height of that land becomes the sum of the two heights, and the source land no longer has a height.
        <br><br>
        Each other spirits' {presence} in your land also increase the height of that land by 1 per {presence} and may force pushes as other
        spirits' add or remove presence to you lands.
        <br><br>
        One of your growth options allows you to split up a pillar and push some of its presence (this is the only exception to the push rule). When you do, the height of both lands in question must be equal to
        the original land, but you choose how it's divided. The only exception if the originating land had a height of 1, in which case both new lands have a height of 1.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>The Ever Shifting Landscape</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        Each of your lands may have not have more element tokens than {presence}. If you ever have a land with more {presence} than element tokens, discard tokens
        until there are the same as the number of presence in that land.
        <br><br>
        When you uncover a {star} in your presence track, you choose an element token to place there. You cannot choose
        an element token that you have already placed on your presence track. If you return presence to that spot on the track,
        remove the element token there.
        <br><br>
        When you add {presence} from your track, you may also add an element token to the land where you added that {presence}.
        <br><br>
        During the turn, for each {star} you have on your element tracks, you gain 1 of that type of element for
        each land you have with that element token and a height that is a multiple of the energy value on the track
        slot. As the turn proceeds, you may gain or lose elements as the heights and tokens of your pillars change.
        The elements provided by this change as your pillars move.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Power in Perfection</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        You may not gain major power cards. At the beginning of the game, look at the top 6 cards of the major power
        deck, discarding any that don't target lands and drawing new ones. Pick two of those powers and set them aside.
        If you were ever to gain a major power, instead gain a minor power.
        <br><br>
        After you resolve a major power with your innate ability "The Powers Align", discard that power. Then look at the top 4
        cards of the major power deck, replacing any that don't target lands, pick 1 and set it aside for future use.
