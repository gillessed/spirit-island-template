        <br><br>
        When you add a presence to a land, that presence needs to track its pillar height. You can use energy tokens to track this.
        Whenever the height of that presence changes, if that height is now coprime with any adjacent lands' heights, in each of those
        lands, push all {presence} from those lands. Height trackers and element tokens move with the {presence}. {presence} cannot be
        pushed into the originating land. This movement may cause cascading {presence} movement. You must keep pushing until you arrive
        at a configuration where no movement is required.
        <br><br>
        When you add {presence} to a land without a height, it's height becomes 1. Height can never be lower than 1. If it would ever
        become lower than 1, it becomes 1 instead.
        <br><br>
        When your {presence} is destroyed in a land, if the land still has presence, subtract 1 from the height. Otherwise remove all height
        and element tokens.
        <br><br>
        When you push your presence from a land into a land with presence, the new height of that land becomes the sum of the two heights.
        <br><br>
        Other spirits' {presence} in your land also increase the height of that land by 1 per {presence} and may force pushes as other
        spirits' add or remove presence to you lands.
        <br><br>
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>The Ever Shifting Landscape</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        Each of your lands may have not have more element tokens than {presence}. If you ever have a land with more tokens, discard tokens
        until there are the same as the number of presence in that land.
        <br><br>
        When you uncover a {star} in your presence track, you choose an element token to place there. You cannot choose
        an element token that you have already placed on your presence track. If you return presence to that spot on the track,
        remove the element token there.
        <br><br>
        When you add {presence} from your track, you may also add an element token to the land where you added that {presence}.
        <br><br>
        During the growth phase, for each {star} you have on your element tracks, you gain 1 of that type of element for
        each land you have with that element token and a pillar height that is a multiple of the energy value on the track
        slot.

      <special-rules-subtitle>Power in Perfection</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        You may not gain major power cards. At the beginning of the game, look at the top 6 cards of the major power
        deck, discarding any that don't target lands and drawing new ones. Pick two of those powers and set them aside.
        <br><br>
        After you resolve a major power with your innate ability "The Powers Align", discard that power. Then look at the top 4
        cards of the major power deck, replacing any that don't target lands, pick 1 and set it aside for future use.
