      <special-rules-subtitle>Divine Math</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        You start with 26 {presence}, putting 2 {presence} in each space on your track. When you add {presence} from
        your track, you add both of the {presence} in that slot. They do not have to be added to the same land.
        <br><br>
        Your lands form pillar with height equal to the number of {presence} in that land. Whenever your lands' height
        changes, if that height is now coprime with any adjacent lands' heights, you may push {presence}
        out of a land such that the pillars in question are no longer adjacent. Element tokens move with the {presence}.
        This movement cause cascading {presence} movement, but you can only move {presence} out of each land once.
        <br><br>
        One of your growth options allows you to split up a pillar and push some of its {presence} (this is the only
        exception to the push rule). This {presence} can be pushed to a land with {presence} already in it, increasing
        that pillar's height.When you do, you may push any number of {presence} from the source land to an
        adjacent land, along with any number of element tokens.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>The Ever Shifting Landscape</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        For every four {presence} in your lands (rounded up), that land may have one element token in it. If you ever
        lose {presence} in a land such that this rule is broken, you must remove element tokens until it is satisfied.
        <br><br>
        When you uncover a {star} in your presence track, place an element token there. You cannot choose
        the same element token more than once. If you return presence to that spot on the track, remove the element
        token there.
        <br><br>
        When you add {presence} from your track, you may also add an element token to the land where you added that
        {presence}.
        <br><br>
        During the turn, for each {star} you have on your element tracks, you gain 1 of that type of element for
        each land you have with that element token and a height that is a multiple of the energy value on the track
        slot. As the turn proceeds, you may gain or lose elements as the heights and tokens of your pillars change.
        The elements provided by this change as your pillars grow and shrink.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Power in Perfection</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        You may not gain major power cards. At the beginning of the game, look at the top 6 cards of the major power
        deck, discarding any that don't target lands and drawing replacements. Pick two of those powers and set them
        aside.
        If you were ever to gain a major power, instead gain a minor power.
        <br><br>
        After you resolve a major power with your innate ability "The Powers Align", discard that power. Then look at
        the top 4
        cards of the major power deck, replacing any that don't target lands, pick 1 and set it aside for future use.
