        <lore-description>
            Long has the Hunstman guided the children of Spirit Island on how to sustain themselves off the fruits of
            the land. The Hunstman teaches the dahan to coexist with the land, and only take what's necessary using
            talents and traditions that are passed down generation to generation.
