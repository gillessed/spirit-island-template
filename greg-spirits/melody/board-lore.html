                    Put 1 {presence} and 1 {beast} in land #4. Take a number of element tokens equal to the number of lands on your board, divided as evenly as possible
                    between {earth}, {air}, {plant} and {animal}. Place one of these tokens randomly on each land on your board without {presence}. You take the remaining element token.
