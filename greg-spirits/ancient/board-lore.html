                    You have only 1 unique power. During setup, draw 12 minor powers, and 1 major power, and begin the game with them in your hand. You begin
                    the game with all 13 of your {presence} on your board, distributed in any way you like. Your growth options require you to
                    instead return {presence} to your tracks. As you do, you return them to the left-most slot with a value, and the current
                    value of your growth tracks is the left-most uncovered value.
