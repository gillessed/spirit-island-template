      <special-rule>
        Whenever time passes, put all non-unique powers played into your knowledge pool instead of your discard. Whenever another spirit gains a power card,
        if they have {presence} in one of your lands, they may gain a specific card from your knowledge pool instead. If that power
        is a major power card, they may gain it without forgetting a card if they pay 2 energy.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Growing Old</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        Whenever an action allows you to add {presence} from your track, you may instead return {presence} from the board to one of
        your tracks.

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);

			Adding Presence: add-presence(1); add-presence(1,jungle); add-presence(2,town,city,blight,or); add-presence(2,strife,city,and);
			
			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)
