        During each spirit phase, you gain an event card. Look at the bottom 2 event cards, pick one and discard the
        rest. If you are playing with any placed event cards, and you look through the whole deck, remember where the
        placed card was, reshuffle the deck, and replace the placed event.

        During spirit phase, you gain 2 energy that is kept in a separate pool. This energy can only be used to pay for
        choice events.
