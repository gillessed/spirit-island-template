      <special-rule>
        Any capital L with a subscript refers to that land's number on t`he board. When referring to movement or targeting, Lₛ is the source land, and Lₜ is the target land. Kₓ refers to the number of
        boards on the board of Lₓ.
        <br><br>
        In lands with your {presence} L, the only adjacent lands to each land L are L + 1 mod K and L - 1 mod K on the same board, and all lands with the same number L on different boards. This rule is also used
        to determine range for you powers.

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);

			Adding Presence: add-presence(1); add-presence(1,jungle); add-presence(2,town,city,blight,or); add-presence(2,strife,city,and);
			
			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)
