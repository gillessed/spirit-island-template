      <special-rule>
        Any capital L with a subscript refers to that land's number on the board. When referring to movement or targeting, Lₛ is the source land, and Lₜ is the target land. Kₓ refers to the number of
        boards on the board of Lₓ.
        <br><br>
        When targeting from land L₁ to L₂, if they are on the same board and L₁ ≠ L₂ the range between those lands is the smallest R such that (|L₁ - L₂| - R = 0 mod K). If L₁ = L₂, but the lands are on different boards,
        the range between those lands is considered to be 1. You can combine these rules to figure out range to different numbered lands on different boards.
        <br><br>
        In lands with your {presence}, adjacency and range of lands for all actions is determined by the above rule instead of the normal board adjacency.
