      <special-rule>
        Any powers that target your lands that grants defense, does damage or gathers/pushes invaders, or adds or removes tokens, must instead do so as evenly
        as possible between all of you lands, but broken up into integer chunks. For example, if you wouldgrant defend 7 to one of your lands, if you have 4 lands, you must grant defend
        2 to 3 of your lands, and defend 1 to the other. If you card has an effect based on the number of invaders, for example, 1 damage to each invader, instead you must total that up first,
        and then divide the effect between your lands.
        <br><br>
        Your powers can never target lands without your {presence}.

        If blight would be place in one of your lands, you may forget a power card to have it be placed in an adjacent land.
