        Your abilities can convert enemy invaders to your side. Enemies that are converted only remain so as long as they are in lands with your {presence}. Whenever an action moves
        invaders, it can move both normal and corrupted invaders. Whenever corrupted invaders move out of your lands, you can move up to 1 {presence} per invader with them. Converted
        invaders do not count towards the win condition, but still generate fear when destroyed. If converted invaders are every in a land without your {presence}, they become normal
        invaders once again.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rule>
        During ravage, converted invaders do damage at the same time as normal invaders. They only do damage to normal invaders. Normal invaders do their damage to converted invaders in
        addition to the land and {dahan}.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rule>
        Lands with converted invaders get defend 1 for each of your {presence}.
