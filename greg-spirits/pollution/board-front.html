        Your {presence} counts as {blight} for all spirit powers (not growth). When {blight} is added to a land with your {presence}, it cascades.
        <br><br>
        This can allow powers to remove your blight and put your {presence} into the blight pool. The next time {blight} is added to the island, your {presence} can be added instead, but it does count as {blight} and cause cascades for this action.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Pollution Proliferates</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        Once per turn, if your {presence} would be destroyed from adding {blight}, you can push up to 1 of those {presence} instead.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Profusion of Waste</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        When the island becomes blighted, immediately gain a minor power. During growth, if the island is blighted, you gain +1 energy.
      </special-rule>
      <special-rules-subtitle>Toxic Biproducts</special-rules-subtitle>
      <special-rule>
        Whenever {blight} is added during ravage to a land with your {presence}, it does 2 damage to invaders in that land.

			Examples include: reclaim-all; reclaim-one; move-presence(1); gain-energy(2);

			Sub-Groups of Growth are possible (think Lure)
